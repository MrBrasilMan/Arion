Welcome to Arion!

To load a new webpage, go up and input it in the address bar above, and then press the Go! button to go to the site.
You can include a full url (https://www.example.com) or just the starting address (example.com)

Arion is proud to be open source and kind of bad (code wise)
I am trying not to be so *&^# at programming, so let me know if I am doing something redundant memory-wise, as I want to try and have enhanced preformance.

2.0 Plans

Arion is supposed to be minimalistic, but I am eventually planning to have a search feature, that is able to detect if there is a .com or .net or whatever in
the address bar, and if not, to use Google's API to get a list of results.

Likewise, saving is something that may be useful to users, and I will try and create either a history.txt file that would update itself, or a bookmark button that
saves bookmarked files to bookmarks.txt. Or both!

That's about it
Thanks for your interest in this project.
