Welcome to Arion!

To load a new webpage, go up and input it in the address bar above, and then press the Go! button to go to the site.
You can include a full url (https://www.example.com) or just the starting address (example.com)

Arion is proud to be open source and kind of bad (code wise)
I am trying not to be so *&^# at programming, so let me know if I am doing something redundant memory-wise, as I want to try and have enhanced preformance.

2.0 Coming Soon!

Features coming:
  - Bookmarking and loading of bookmarked pages
  - Search being added! (Using Google's Python Module)
  - Adding installer with GUI and more!

I am taking a little break on this project for a week, so this update (which is just to update this home page, as all the codebase is stored somewhere else.) is released as 1.6.
