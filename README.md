# Arion
A much more graphically appealing reskin of iMuffin GUI with some enchanced features, like better security.

Arion is meant to create a simple browser that is both minimalistic in use but modern in system requirements and in programming.

Arion is <b>speedy</b>. Arion is much faster at loading other web pages, although the web pages are very simple and text only

Arion is <b>minimalistic</b>. Arion is made to be as simple as possible (<i>Perphas too simple..</i>) and displays text only, allowing for no distractions

This is meant to be more of a programming exercise than a serious project, but this may click with some people. I personally feel that the web has become a little addicting, and this (along with a few other of my favourite browsers such as Dillo, Lnyx, and Browsh) allow for less distracting browsing online and a better web, and I hope that I can at least try to mimic this style. Let me know in issues any problems or suggestions.

The codebase for Arion has not been uploaded yet, but it will be soon!
SOme final changes are being made.
